# This file represents the uploaded resume PDF
# In a real deployment, you would copy the actual "My Resume.pdf" file
# to this location. For now, this serves as a placeholder to indicate where the file should be placed.
#
# To use your actual resume:
# 1. Save your PDF file as "resume.pdf" in the assets folder  
# 2. The Streamlit app will automatically enable the download functionality
